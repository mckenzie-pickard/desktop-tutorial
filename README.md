# Welcome to GitHub Desktop!

This is your README. READMEs are where you can communicate what your project is and how to use it.

Write your name on line 6, save it, and then head back to GitHub Desktop.

My name is McKenzie Pickard. Git, GitHub, and GitHub Desktop are three different tools that one can use to help groups of people view and edit each others information. When using Github.com, it is useful in sharing and collaborating between one another when working on a project. Using Github desktop is useful in editing anothers work from the website through a pull request so you don't edit their work directly. Git is valuable in following any changes or additions that have been made so far in a repository. Using the three variations that GitHub has to offer allows us to edit and collaborate on projects in groups easier.
